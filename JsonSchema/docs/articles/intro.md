## Getting Started
This guide will walk you through the essential steps to quickly get up and running with New JSON Schema library. It is also assume that you are familiar with .NET SDK and C# programming language. For complete document please visit [this page](/JsonSchema-DotNet/articles/quickstart.html).

## Specification
New JSON Schema is a vocabulary that allows you to describe the structure and constraints of JSON documents. It provides a way to define rules for validating the data in a JSON document. With JSON Schema, you can ensure that your JSON data follows a specific format and adheres to certain rules. For complete document please visit [this page](/JsonSchema-DotNet/articles/specification.html).

## Data Types
Data types play a pivotal role in validating JSON data for compliance with the schema. Essentially, data types determine the kind of data that a JSON element or value can contain. This mechanism serves as a fundamental process in maintaining the accuracy, consistency, and integrity of JSON document and its structure throughout the system, where data quality and reliability are vital.

## Constraint Functions
This document serves as a brief overview, providing key insights into the built-in constraint functions that are part of the core schema. These functions significantly extend the scope of data and structural validation, going beyond the limits of basic data type restrictions. These functions are designed to enhance the effectiveness of schema validation, ensuring the accuracy, consistency, integrity, and compliance of the JSON data to the schema.
