# Introduction
New JSON Schema is a practical tool for defining and validating the structure of JSON documents. It allows you to specify the expected format, data types, and constraints of JSON data. The following guides offer comprehensive details about the New JSON Schema. This document provides a list of previews, each corresponding to a specific detail document available within this project.

## Getting Started
This guide will walk you through the essential steps to quickly get up and running with New JSON Schema library. It is also assumes a modest familiarity with the .NET SDK and .NET CLI (command-line interface) toolchain including basic familiarity with NuGet packages. Additionally, it considers a certain level of knowledge in C# language. For complete document please visit [this page](/JsonSchema-DotNet/articles/quickstart.html).

## Specification
New JSON Schema is a vocabulary that allows you to describe the structure and constraints of JSON documents. It provides a way to define rules for validating the data in a JSON document. With JSON Schema, you can ensure that your JSON data follows a specific format and adheres to certain rules.

## Data Types
Data types play a pivotal role in validating JSON data for compliance with the schema. Essentially, data types determine the kind of data that a JSON element or value can contain. This mechanism serves as a fundamental process in maintaining the accuracy, consistency, and integrity of JSON document and its structure throughout the system, where data quality and reliability are vital.

## Constraint Functions
This document serves as a brief overview, providing key insights into the built-in constraint functions that are part of the core schema. These functions significantly extend the scope of data and structural validation, going beyond the limits of basic data type restrictions. These functions are designed to enhance the effectiveness of schema validation, ensuring the accuracy, consistency, integrity, and compliance of the JSON data to the schema.

## Date and Time Patterns
Dates and times are fundamental data types used in a wide range of data exchange scenarios. This schema offers a comprehensive set of tools for managing dates and times, including pattern-based formatting to meet the unique requirements of various systems and applications. Simultaneously, it incorporates validation processes to ensure compliance with the schema. For complete document please visit [this page](/JsonSchema-DotNet/articles/datetime.html).

## Build from Source Code
This comprehensive guide illustrates the procedures for retrieving source code from a GitHub repository, compiling the project source code into a library, and seamlessly integrating the compiled library into your project. Within this document, we will navigate through these steps, presenting them clearly and straightforwardly. For complete document please visit [this page](/JsonSchema-DotNet/articles/sourcebuild.html).
